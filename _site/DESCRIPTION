Description: ScreenBEAM2 is the upgraded version of ScreenBEAM1. It can perform functional genomics screening from FASTQ file. It is a trim-free, allowing number of mismatch, BLAT-depend pipeline. Downstream analysis uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling, removed bias caused by the unbalanced number of sh/sgRNA targeting the same gene.
