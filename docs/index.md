## Overview
ScreenBEAM2 is the upgraded version of ScreenBEAM1. It can perform functional genomics screening from FASTQ file. It is a trim-free, allowing number of mismatch, BLAT-dependent pipeline. Downstream analysis uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling, removed bias caused by the unbalanced number of sh/sgRNA targeting the same gene.

## Citing ScreenBEAM2
If ScreenBEAM2 is useful to your work, please cite the following paper: Yu J, Silva, J, Califano A. ScreenBEAM: a Novel Meta-Analysis Algorithm for Functional Genomics Screens via Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling. _Bioinformatics, 2015 Sep 28. pii: btv556.
